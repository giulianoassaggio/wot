help <command> to get help on a command
$ bin/wot help sign-toml
  bin/wot sign-toml

  Get a toml object from stdin, add a valid hash and a valid signature.

  --force-accept-hash do not check the hash of the object
  --json-output return a json object (with TOML signature)

  See also `help sign`.
$ bin/wot help sign     
  bin/wot sign

  Get an object from stdin, add a valid hash and a valid signature.

  --force-accept-hash do not check the hash of the object

  See also `help sign-toml`.
$ bin/wot help verify
  bin/wot verify

  Get an object from stdin and verify if is valid.

  --force-accept-hash do not check the hash of the object
  --force-accept-sig do not check the signature of the object
$ bin/wot help add   
  bin/wot add

  Add an object to the internal db."
  The object is readed from stdin and is verified before of adding it."

  --force-accept-hash do not check the hash of the object";
  --force-accept-sig do not check the signature of the object
$ bin/wot help ls-rules
  bin/wot ls-rules

  List all the rules found in the links of the objects of the internal db.
  The number next to every rule is how many times it is present in the links.
$ bin/wot help ls      
  bin/wot [--rule-filter RULE] [--to-filter TO] [from-filter FROM] ls

  List of the objects in the internal db filtered against the provided filters.

  BUG: The objects are first filtered, then are listed as full object.
  This means that if a single link of an object pass the filter, then all the links are shown.
$ bin/wot help add-sig
  bin/wot --signature <SIGNATURE> add-sig <HASH>

  Add a trusted signature to the internal db. When a node having hash HASH is found, it is considered
  valid if the signature of the node is the same as SIGNATURE.
  This skips the verification step. It is useful, for example, on systems without an electrum executable.

  See also `help ls-sig`, `help rm-sig`.
$ bin/wot help rm-sig 
  bin/wot rm-sig <HASH>

  Remove a trusted signature from the internal db.

  See also `help add-sig`, `help ls-sig`.
$ bin/wot help ls-sig
  bin/wot ls-sig

  list all the knwon signatures of the internal cache.

  See also `help add-sig`, `help rm-sig`.
$ bin/wot help view  
  bin/wot view <HASH>

  View the content of the node having hash HASH, from the internal db.
